# What is JS?

It is a versatile and widely-used programming language that plays a crucial role in web development. It enables developers to create interactive and dynamic elements within web pages, enhancing the user experience by adding functionality that responds to user actions. JS is primarily executed in web browsers, but it's also used in other environments like server-side scriptig (Node.js).
